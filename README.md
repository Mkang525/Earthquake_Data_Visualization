<h1>Earthquake Map</h1>
  For the Leaflet challenge, I was able to create a map that displays all earthquakes that have occurred within the past 7 days. Each earthquake is indicated by a circle with a radius equivalent to the magnitude of the earthquake. The location of each circle was taken from the latitude, longitude coordinates given in the GEOjson file. When a circle is clicked on, a pop-up appears with information about the magnitude of the earthquake, the location, as well as a link to the USGS site that provides the user more specific information about that particular earthquake.  In addition, I also created a light and satellite layer with layer controls and also included a legend.
